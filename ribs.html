<h2> Steps </h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and  fit the ribs into a roasting tin.  </li>
    <li>Pour over the cola and enough water to cover the ribs, then cover the tin tightly with foil. Roast for 2-3 hrs, turning halfway through, until the ribs are really tender but not falling apart</li>
        <ul>    
            <li>Meanwhile, put all the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan. Gently heat, then bubble for about 2 mins, stirring.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>When done, lift ribs on kitchen paper to dry. Tip away the liquid and wipe out the tin. 
    <li> Put the dry ribs back in the tin and coat all over with the sticky sauce. Cover and chill for at least 1 hr to marinate, but better still up to 24 hrs. </li>
    <li>Mix the dip ingredients together and chill until ready to serve.</li>
    <li>Heat the barbecue and wait for the flames to die down, then cook ribs for 20 mins, turning occasionally, and basting often with remaining sauce. </li>
    <li> When ribs are sticky and crisping on the outside, slice to serve. Scatter with sesame seeds and plate up with any remaining sauce and the chive dip.</li>
</ol>

<h4>And finally, serve alongside chips and coleslaw to really elevate the experience... enjoy!</h4>
