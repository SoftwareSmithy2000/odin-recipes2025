<h2>Steps (Serves 2):</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook the sushi rice according to the packet instructions and while it is cooking prepare the sushi rice dressing.  </li>
        <ul>
            <li>To do this, mix the rice vinegar, sugar and salt together in a small dish, stirring well until the sugar and salt have dissolved in the vinegar. </li>
            <li> When the rice is cooked, pour the dressing over the top (while it is still hot) and then stir to coat the rice and fluff it up.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Lightly toast the sesame seeds, scatter them over the rice and stir through. Set the rice aside (still in the saucepan) to cool slightly.</li>
    <li> Prepare and then set the followign three elements aside while you prepare the sushi bowl base:
        <ul> 
            <li>Salmon fillets: remove the skin and chop into chunks</li>
            <li> Spring onions: dice to prefered size </li>
            <li> For the teriyaki marinade: mix the maple syrup, sesame oil, tamari, garlic granules and mirin together in a small dish  </li>
        </ul> 
    <li> Split the rice between two wide bowls so that two-thirds of each base is covered. In the remaining third, pile edamame beans and sliced avocado. </li>
    <li> Pour the marinade into a small frying pan over a high heat. When it begins to bubble, turn the heat down to simmering and stir it constantly until it has reduced, turning from watery sauce to a thicker, glaze consistency </li>
    <li>Add the chunks of salmon to the pan and turn the heat back up to high - stir so that the salmon is fully coated in the glaze and then sprinkle the spring onions over the top </li>
    <li>Continue to cook on a high heat for a couple of minutes, stirring occasionally, until the salmon is  glazed and cooked to your preferred level
    <li> Remove from the pan and scoop the teriyaki salmon and spring onions onto the sushi bowls </li>
</ol>

<h4>Voila, one scrumptious meal! Serve with extra soy sauce on the side if you wish. </h4>
